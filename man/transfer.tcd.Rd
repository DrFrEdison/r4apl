\title{Transfer TCD Data}
\usage{
transfer.tcd(tcd1A = NA, tcd2B = NA, colnames = c("time", "TCD1A", "TCD2B"))
}
\arguments{
\item{tcd1A}{A data frame or data table containing TCD1A data with time and signal columns.}

\item{tcd2B}{A data frame or data table containing TCD2B data with time and signal columns.}

\item{colnames}{A character vector specifying the column names for the merged data. Default is \code{c("time", "TCD1A", "TCD2B")}.}
}
\value{
A merged data frame of TCD data containing time, TCD1A, and TCD2B values.
}
\description{
This function merges Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) data from two sources
when the time differences between them are minimal or zero, handling cases where
the number of rows differs by performing a rolling join.

  # Example usage:
