\title{Detect Switching Peaks in GC-TCD Data}
\usage{
gc_switching_peaks(
  data,
  data_x = "time",
  data_y = "TCD2B",
  window_size = 15,
  cut_time = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data.table or data.frame containing the GC data.}

\item{data_x}{Character, the name of the column representing the x-axis (typically time). Default is "time".}

\item{data_y}{Character, the name of the column representing the y-axis (typically the signal, such as TCD2B). Default is "TCD2B".}

\item{window_size}{Numeric, the size of the window (in data points) used to filter out peaks based on their proximity. Default is 15.}

\item{cut_time}{Numeric, the time threshold beyond which peaks are considered. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
Numeric, the average time point where a switching peak occurs. Returns NA if no peak is found.
}
\description{
This function identifies switching peaks in Gas Chromatography (GC) Thermoconductivity Detector (TCD) data.
It detects negative-to-positive crossings within a specified time window.
