\title{Transfer TCD Data}
\usage{
transfer_tcd(TCD1A = NA, TCD2B, colnames = c("RT", "TCD1A", "TCD2B"))
}
\arguments{
\item{TCD1A}{A data frame or data table containing TCD1A data with RT and TCD columns. Default is \code{NA}.}

\item{TCD2B}{A data frame or data table containing TCD2B data with RT and TCD columns.}

\item{colnames}{A character vector specifying the column names for the merged data. Default is \code{c("RT", "TCD1A", "TCD2B")}.}
}
\value{
A merged data frame or data table of TCD data containing RT, TCD1A, and TCD2B values.
If \code{TCD1A} is \code{NA}, only \code{TCD2B} is returned.
}
\description{
This function merges Thermal Conductivity Detector (TCD) data from two sources,
handling cases where one source is \code{NA}, or the RT differences between them
are minimal or zero. It also supports rolling joins when the number of rows differs.

  # Example usage:
  merged_data <- transfer_tcd(TCD1A, TCD2B, colnames = c("RT", "TCD1A", "TCD2B"))
